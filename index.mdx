# Chapter 14

## Long Live the Queen

---

## Overview

<Notes>
  Tell audience about how bees are a great example of epigenetics in the wild.

Presentation will start with a brief review on bees, then go into
more interesting bits around how epigenetics plays a role.

</Notes>

---

## Bees

Have colonies with different social roles

<img src="./assets/bee-sizes.png" />

- Female Worker bees
- A small amount of male bees (aka Drones)
- The Queen

<Notes>
  Quick overview of bees here.

Worker bees collect pollen and nectar. They make wax.

Drones are only really there to mate.

Make note that the queen is quite different and lead into next slide.

</Notes>

---

## The Queen

- Genetically identical to thousands of other worker bees
  but develop quite differently.
- Much larger than than worker bees.
- No sting barbs, wax glands, or pollen baskets.
- Only type of female that can mate.
- Can live for years, whereas worker bees can
  only live a few months.

<Notes>
  Because queens mate several times, not all bees are
  genetically identical to each other, but in a colony
  thousands of them can be.

Make note that the queen is interesting because it's quite different from
the others (larger, only female that can mate).

Fun fact: lifespan of worker bees varies depending
on the season they were born.

## Royal Jelly

- All larvae are fed this for the first 2 days of life.
- On the 3rd day, most larvae are switched to a diet of pollen and nectar.

<Notes>
  Lead into next slide, showing that most of these bees become workers.
</Notes>

## Worker bee

<img src="./assets/worker_bee.jpg" style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }} />

<Notes>These bees will go on to support the colony.</Notes>

---

## The rest of them

The others remain on the royal jelly diet and grow up to become queens.

<img src="./assets/queen_bee.jpg" style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }} />

<Notes>
  The new queens eventually leave the hive with drones and workers to start a
  new colony.

Not quite sure what exactly causes nurse bees to continue feeding royal
jelly to a select few.

</Notes>

## Epigenetics, duh

<Notes>lol</Notes>

## Research back in 2006

- Some researchers decided to sequence the genomes of honey bees.
- Found that the genome contained genes that looked
similar to DNA methyltransferase genes of higher organisms.
- Genome showed to contain a lot of CpG motifs.

<Notes>
This provides evidence that honeybees may possess a DNA methylation system.

DNA methyltransferase - enzymes that catalyze the transfer
of a methyl group from S-Adenosyl methionine. These enzymes are required for
the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns
</Notes>

---

## More research back in 2006

- Research group led by Gene Robinson in Illinois found that
DNA methyltransferase proteins encoded in the genome were active.
- Proteins were able to add methyl groups to the cytosine
residue in a CpG motif.
- There were also proteins expressed that were able to bind to methylated DNA.

<Notes>
Together, this shows that cells could both read and write epigenetic code.

Before this data was publishd, no one thought to
check if honey bees they had a DNA methylation system
because everyone kind of thought that it would be similar to the fruit fly
`Drosophila melanogaster`
</Notes>

## Even more research

Dr. Ryszard Maleszka and his colleagues (Austrailian National University
in Canberra) discovered that by switching off the `Dnmt3` gene,
they could create queen bees without prolonged feeding with royal jelly.

<img src="./assets/dmnt3_and_bees.png" style={{ maxHeight: '500px' }} />

<Notes>
`Dnmt3` is responsible for adding methyl groups to regions of DNA that
haven't been methylated before.

Because knocking down `Dnmt3` had the same effects of feedling royal jelly.

This suggests that royal jelly is connected to alterations of the
DNA methylation patterns on important genes.

The researchers also examined the DNA methylation and gene expression patterns
in different experimental groups of bees to back up the hypothesis
and found that the methylation patterns between natural queen bees and
the knockdown queen bees were very similar.
</Notes>

---

## Gaps

No one has been able demonstrate that royal jelly really inhibits the
DNA methyltransferase enzyme, it's possible that the
effect of royal jelly on DNA methylation is indirect.

<Notes>
No one knows what exactly is causing the enzyme to be inhibited.
</Notes>

---

## What we do know

- Royal jelly does influence on hormonal signalling in honey bees
and this changes gene expression patterns.
- Changes in the levels of expressions of a gene influence the
epigenetic modifications.
- The more highly a gene is switched on, the more it's histones can be
modified in ways that promote gene expression.

<Notes>
Something similar may be happening for honeybees.

DNA methylation systems and histone modification systems often work together.
This his stirred up interest in the role of histone modifying enzymes in
the control of honeybee development.

</Notes>

# TODO

- Talk about research on compound found in in royal jelly
- the other effects of methylation in bees
- other places where there are similar effects seen in other insect species
- close
